# UIST Student Innovation Contest 2017 
Welcome to the UIST Student Innovation Contest 2017, which features the desktop-sized robotic arm Arduino Braccio. 

## getting started

1. Once you receive your braccio, the first task is to get it assembled. Here's your [easiest starting point](assemble-instructions/Braccio_Quick_Start_Guide.pdf) (.pdf, step by step instructions.) 
2. The next step is connecting your braccio's servo shield to your arduino UNO (it is possible to use other arduinos or even other micro controllers but for simplicity the shields retrofit nicely in the UNO without any mods). 
3. Get ready to start your code examples! Get acquainted with the Arduino Braccio library. 


## Programming languages, environments & dialects

Arduino's can interface with virtually anything as long as a serial port is there (it can be wireless, blue tooth, smoke signs, whatever! oh.. and USB too). This being said reinventing the wheel typically takes more time than you'll have for the UIST SIC, so try to leverage some existing programming environment that already has some features to control/communicate with arduinos. Here's some of them:

1. [Snap4Arduino](http://www.snap4arduino.org/) (if you like visual programming this is your best tool) and luckily there is a [Snap Braccio Library](https://github.com/bromagosa/Snap4Arduino/tree/master/src/libraries) contributed by our dear friend @bromagosa and here is a [video of that library in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKZco88P9X0).
